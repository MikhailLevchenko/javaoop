# SQLite JDBC, developed by Taro L. Saito, is a library
# for accessing and creating SQLite database files in Java.
#
# Our SQLiteJDBC library requires no configuration
# since native libraries for major OSs, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux etc.,
# are assembled into a single JAR (Java Archive) file.
# The usage is quite simple; download our sqlite-jdbc library,
# then append the library (JAR file) to your class path.
